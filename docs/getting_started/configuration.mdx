For our first example, we are going to compose a GraphQL schema from the REST APIs at <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" target="_blank">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com</a>, a free online REST API with some fake data.
We will use the API at `/users` to get a list of users, and `/users/:id/posts` to get the posts for each user, and compose them into a single GraphQL schema.

Create a file called `jsonplaceholder.graphql` and paste the following contents into it.

```graphql showLineNumbers
schema
  # Specify server configuration: Start tailcall server at 0.0.0.0:8000 and enable GraphiQL playground
  @server(port: 8000, enableGraphiql: true)
  # Specify a base url for all http requests
  @upstream(baseURL: "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com") {
  query: Query
}

type Query {
  # Specify the http path for the users query
  users: [User] @http(path: "/users")
}

# Create a user type with the fields returned by the users api
type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  username: String!
  email: String!

  # Extend the user type with the posts field
  # Use the current user's id to construct the path
  posts: [Post] @http(path: "/users/{{value.id}}/posts")
}

# Create a post type with the fields returned by the posts api
type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
```

The above file is a standard `.graphQL` file, with a few additions such as `@upstream` and `@http` directives. So basically we specify the GraphQL schema and how to resolve that GraphQL schema in the same file, without having to write any code!
